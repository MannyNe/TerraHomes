    <h1>Introduction to Terraform</h1>

    <h2>What is Terraform?</h2>
    <p>Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and
        provision infrastructure resources declaratively using a simple and human-readable configuration language.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Terraform</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Declarative Configuration:</strong> With Terraform, you define your desired infrastructure state in
            code, specifying the desired resources, configurations, and relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code:</strong> Terraform treats your infrastructure as code, enabling version
            control, collaboration, and reproducibility. Infrastructure changes can be reviewed, tested, and deployed
            like any other code.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Cloud Provisioning:</strong> Terraform supports provisioning infrastructure resources across
            major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, as well as other platforms like VMware, Docker, and
            more.</li>
    </ul>
