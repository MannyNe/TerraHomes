            the mysterious Time Variance Authority (TVA), a bureaucratic organization that exists outside of time and space and
            monitors the timeline. They give Loki a choice: face being erased from existence due to being a "time-variant", or help
            fix the timeline and stop a greater threat. Loki ends up in his own crime thriller, traveling through time,
            hunting a female version of himself named Sylvie.</p>
